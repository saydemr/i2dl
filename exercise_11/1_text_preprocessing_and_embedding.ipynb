    "\n",
    "Welcome to this new exercise! In this exercise, we will play around with text instead of images as before, using Recurrent Neural Networks. Generally, it is called Natural Language Processing (NLP) when dealing with text, speech, etc. But the data structure is very different from images, i.e., text is a string, while images consist of numbers. Hence, we need some preprocessing steps to transform the raw text into another data format. This notebook will introduce these basic concepts in NLP pipelines. Specifically, you will learn about:\n",

If we use a vector for each word, the above relation can be expressed as $vec(\\text{women})-vec(\\text{man}) \\approx vec(\\text{queen}) - vec(\\text{king})$. Usually we call such vector representations as embeddings.\n",
